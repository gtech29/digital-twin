# Digital Twin Dashboard

## Project Overview
I developed this project during my internship with the Navy, focuses on building a **Digital Twin dashboard** for controllers operating under protocols such as **DNP3, BACnet, and Modbus**.

The system:
- Collects and interprets controller data  
- Analyzes incoming traffic in real time  
- Presents insights in a user-friendly dashboard  
- Enables users to test and adjust parameters with flexibility  

To extend its capabilities, the system integrates a **large language model (LLM)** that analyzes data and generates **predictions for optimal resource usage**. These predictions feed into containerized environments simulating the controllers, enabling traffic analysis and informed decision-making.

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository serves as **living documentation** of the project’s progress.

- The setup is intended to be reproducible, so others can follow along.  
- The project reflects a **learning-by-doing** approach: I’ll share helpful references as I discover them.  
- The system will be built in **phases**, starting with a skeleton dashboard and expanding toward a fully integrated architecture.  
- While I’m starting from the **front end**, others are welcome to approach it differently.

## Collaboration and Support
If you’ve read this far—thank you, I truly appreciate your time and interest.  

- Got ideas? Contributions and discussions are welcome.  
- Reach out with questions or suggestions.  
- This is a work in progress, and updates will be shared along the way.  
- I leverage AI tools as coding assistants to accelerate implementation, while focusing my effort on system architecture, integration, and problem-solving.
- This approach lets me build complex systems efficiently while ensuring I understand and control every component.
